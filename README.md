# mapping_dataDXF to SHP File Conversion and Visualization 📐🌍
This folder contains tools and scripts for converting DXF files (commonly used in CAD software) into SHP files (a popular GIS format), as well as for symbolizing and visualizing spatial data in QGIS.

# 🚀 Features
1. DXF to SHP Conversion

## Transform CAD files into shapefiles for GIS analysis.
Automated Symbolization in QGIS

Python scripts to automate styling and symbolization for easy visualization.
Interactive Mapping

Jupyter Notebook showcasing mapping workflows and visualizations.
# 📂 Folder Structure
code_symbolisation_qgis.py
Python script for automating the symbolization of shapefiles in QGIS.

data/
(Optional) Placeholder for input DXF files and output SHP files.

# 📋 How to Use
1. DXF to SHP Conversion
Ensure you have QGIS installed on your machine.

Open QGIS and import your DXF file.
Use the "Save As" function to export the data as a shapefile (SHP).
2. Automated Symbolization
Run the Python script to apply predefined styles to your shapefiles.

bash
Copier le code
python code_symbolisation_qgis.py  
3. Mapping and Visualization
Open mapping.ipynb to explore data visualization and mapping workflows.

bash
Copier le code
jupyter notebook mapping.ipynb  
# 💻 Technologies Used
