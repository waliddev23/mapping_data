# mapping_dataDXF to SHP File Conversion and Visualization 📐🌍
This folder contains tools and scripts for converting DXF files (commonly used in CAD software) into SHP files (a popular GIS format), as well as for symbolizing and visualizing spatial data in QGIS.

# 🚀 Features
1. DXF to SHP Conversion

  -  Transform CAD files into shapefiles for GIS analysis.
2. Automated Symbolization in QGIS

  - Python scripts to automate styling and symbolization for easy visualization.
3. Interactive Mapping

  - Jupyter Notebook showcasing mapping workflows and visualizations.
# 📂 Folder Structure
- code_symbolisation_qgis.py

  Python script for automating the symbolization of shapefiles in QGIS.

- mapping.ipynb

  Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the conversion process and mapping workflows, including data visualization techniques.

- data/

  (Optional) Placeholder for input DXF files and output SHP files.

  
# 💻 Technologies Used
- GIS Software: QGIS
